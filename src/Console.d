  // a console is a command-like tool that can parse and execute debug commands, and display debug information
  
  // it needs to show the latest output
  
  // it should have an input line that the user can type commands into
  
  // it should hide and deactivate when the toggle console button is pressed
  
  // example debugging would be something like:
  // getValues(playerShip)              - prints all name/value pairs for the player ship entity
  // playerShip.position = 0 0          - set position value to 0 0
  // updateEntity(playerShip)           - updates player entity, will put the playership at 0 0
  // newShip.source = simpleship.txt    - creates a new entity if there is none named newShip
  // newShip.position = 10 10           - sets the position value of the new ship
  // newShip.control = NpcPilot         - sets the control value so the ship will be computer controlled
  // registerEntity(newShip)            - registers the new entity, spawning it at 10 10
