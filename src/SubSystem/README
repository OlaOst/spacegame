How subsystems works today:
CollisionHandler    - Handles collision detection and response between entities
ConnectionHandler   - Holds together entities like those making up a ship, and aggregates values like mass and forces
Controller          - Players and AI/NPCs control entities via this subsystem
Graphics            - Draws entities
Physics             - Moves entities
Placer              - Keeps track of entity positions and wraparound
Sound               - Plays sounds and music
Spawner             - Handles entities that can spawn other entities, and values of the spawned entities
Timer               - Keeps track of time for entities that need it



How subsystems would work in a better world:
Placer            - for entities that need a position (could be gameworld position or hud position or menu position or some other position)
Physics           - for entities that are affected by forces and follow newtons laws of motion
Spawner           - for entities that can create other entities (needs trigger to know when to spawn something)
Collision         - for entities that should affect each other when overlapping. response depends on the collision type (cursor should change color/symbol according to what it is pointing at, physical entities should push each other apart and not overlap)
Input             - for entities that are affected by external input (could be user input, could be AI)
Relation          - for entities that affect other entities (like keeping the position of one entity locked relative to another entity)
Sound             - for entities that can be heard (audible clicks from menu buttons, gunfire from cannons, etc)
Graphics          - for entities that should be shown on screen
Timer             - for entities that need to keep track of time (usually a countdown, for reloading guns or controlling the lifetime of bullets)

after subsystems have finished updating, they need to update each other values in the correct order to avoid looking at stale values the next update:

Timer updates (something?) in Control (because guns should only be able to fire when they have finished reloading - how to abstract this nicely?)

Control updates triggers in Spawner

Control updates triggers in Sound
Spawner updates triggers in Sound
Collision updates triggers in Sound

Control updates forces in Physics
Spawner updates forces in Physics (recoil forces)
Collision updates forces in Physics

Physics updates position in Placer
Collision updates position in Placer
Relation updates position in Placer

Placer updates position in all other subsystems having position values
